				Literary and Debating Society was established in the academic year 2003-04 and is one of the oldest societies in Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology [KIIT (Deemed to be University)]. The members of Kronicle Society firmly believe in the quote “It is better to debate a question without settling it, than to settle a question without debating it” by Joseph Joubert. Our motto, per Veritatum Veritas or through freedom the truth shall be set free, bears a testament to the fact that in every case of turmoil, in every source of discourse, we strongly strive to arrive at a solution inoculating facts, logic and strong convincing power. Debating is a skill people are born with, but has to be borne as a responsibility for a free, fair and better world. Through such determination and perseverance, we endeavor to prepare ourselves and people around us, to strengthen their shoulders and carry this responsibility forward.<br>

order’ by the Chairperson.

				Prof. Achyuta Samanta is an educationist, philanthropist, and social worker. He is the founder of
				Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology (KIIT) and Kalinga Institute of Social Sciences (KISS), both
				educational institutions of global repute and recognition. KIIT is an Institution of Eminence and one of
				the most prominent universities in India and globe for professional education having more than 30,000
				students from all over India and 53 other countries. KISS is a home for 60,000 indigenous children all
				absolutely free.<br><br>

				Besides Education and tribal upliftment, healthcare and rural development, Shri. Samanta has contributed
				immensely to art, culture, literature, film, media, society and national integration. It is really
				incredible that the child who lost his father at the age of four, brought up amidst severe poverty and
				deprivation with seven siblings and a widow mother in a quaint village in Odisha has accomplished this
				monumental work without any favour or backing in such a short span of time for the society. He has
				converted the remote village ‘Kalarabanka’, Cuttack into a Smart Village and the entire Manpur Panchayat
				into a model Panchayat (cluster of villages).<br><br>

				He has been conferred with more than 50 International and National awards and over 200 state awards
				besides two highest Civilian Awards from Royal Kingdom of Bahrain and Mongolia. He has been conferred
				with 44 Honorary Doctorate awards from universities in India and abroad. He is the first Odia to be a
				member of both UGC and AICTE. He is currently the Member of Parliament (Lok Sabha) from Kandhamal,
				Odisha and also the President of Volleyball Federation of India.<br><br>

				As a social reformer, he has been propagating “Art of Giving” (philosophy of life), a concept aimed at
				bringing peace and happiness around the globe. <br><br>

				Despite all his achievements, he leads a simple lifestyle, keeps on marching towards the cause of
				spreading smile among millions and achieving zero poverty, zero hunger, zero illiteracy.
